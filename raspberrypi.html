    <h1>What is a <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/raspberry-pi">Raspberry Pi?</a></h1>
    <p>Raspberry Pi is the name of a series of single-board computers made by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, 
        a UK charity that aims to educate people in computing and create easier access to computing education.

        The Raspberry Pi launched in 2012, and there have been several iterations and variations released since then. 
        The original Pi had a single-core 700MHz CPU and just 256MB RAM, and the latest model has a quad-core CPU clocking in at over 1.5GHz, and 4GB RAM. The price point for Raspberry Pi has always been under $100 (usually around $35 USD), most notably the Pi Zero, which costs just $5.
        
        All over the world, people use the Raspberry Pi to learn programming skills, build hardware projects, do home automation, 
        implement Kubernetes clusters and Edge computing, and even use them in industrial applications.
        
        The Raspberry Pi is a very cheap computer that runs Linux, but it also provides a set of GPIO (general purpose input/output) pins, 
        allowing you to control electronic components for physical computing and explore the Internet of Things (IoT).</p></center>
